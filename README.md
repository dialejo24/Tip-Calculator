## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

This was a good challenge to learn many things, specially related to customizing inputs. 
I also remembered some things that i had forgotten. 

Some meaningful code snippets:
```css
input[type="number"]::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
input[type="number"]::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
    -webkit-appearance: none;
}
::placeholder{
    color:var(--grayish-cyan);
    opacity: 1;
}
::-webkit-input-placeholder { 
    color: var(--grayish-cyan);
}
.buttons {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill,minmax(110px,1fr));
    gap:1em;
}
```

### Continued development

My goal is to keep improving on my frontend skills. I want to get really good at CSS and JS. I also
want to focus on accesability and semantic HTML.
